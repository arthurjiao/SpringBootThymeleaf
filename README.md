# SpringBootThymeleaf
This is an upgrade of my MVC project with Thymeleaf and SpringBoot. In this project, POM  provides the support from the dependencies of Spring-Boot-Starter-Web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, mysql-connector-java and etc.  Thus the heavy work in configuration is simplified and the coding load in DAO and service is also reduced. The view part is developed in Thymeleaf and the controller also functions well in all CRUD operations. Since the database is MySql, the MySql script is also provided here.
